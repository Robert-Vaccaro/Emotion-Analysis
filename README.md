# Summary/Flow #

#### First View:  ####

The user will see a 'start' screen where there will be a 
type of animation (which includes a animated background) asking the user if they are ready to start.

#### Second View:  ####

Once they click the start button, they will be taken to 
the emotion anaysis portion where there will be a title "Emotion Analysis", a 
header asking to "tell me about your day" then there will 
be a text area with the placeholder "my day was..." then 
a analyze button that will analyze the entry.

#### Third View: ####
 
Once they click the analyze button, all the information 
(that I format with Jquery, JS, etc...) that comes from 
the two different API's will display below the analzye button, which includes the emotion percentages 
and pictures.
